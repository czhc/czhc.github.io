# Tenets
----

## 1. Result is King

The end result, above people, process, tools and everything else, is the only true measure of a team and individual.

## 2. Continuous Leanrning

Learning is an experience than an end result, and its acquisition in moments, boundless and lifelong.


## 3. Enable and Empower

Knowledge is about empowerment; it can only grow with people.

## 4. Purpose

Talent is synonymous to impact; repurpose, reinvent, realign one's growth and their surroundings with the mission to create value in every aspect of one's decisions.
