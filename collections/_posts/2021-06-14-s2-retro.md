## Consensus Systems

A blockchain is a decentralized peer-to-peer system, and its novelty lies in decision-making (or truth verification) with no central authority - using a combination of cryptographic/mathematical proofs and economic incentives.

Coordinating nodes (computers) in a network is not unlike coordinating humans in a group to achieve an ideal, unified outcome.

This problem is illustrated in the [Byzantine Generals Problem](http://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/byz.pdf) as a group of generals coordinating a single attack-or-retreat decision - with the caveat that some of them may betray the relay of message between each other.

_In a p2p payments network, that will be equivalent to nodes maliciously modifying transactions (balances, debit/credit, history etc.), being slow or simply going offline._

**[Nelson](https://marknelson.us/posts/2007/07/23/byzantine.html?utm_referral=https://czhc.dev) summarizes the _Interactive Consistency_ conditions for a solution (i.e. Byzantine Fault-Tolerant) solution as having:**

* guaranteed termination: all generals can form a decision based on the received messages
* agreement: all generals share the same final decision
* validity: all generals arrive at the same decision, which was the original and correct decision


The Lamport naive solution states that:
> _The problem is only solvable iff. more than two-thirds of the generals are loyal_

The Bitcoin network applies BFT by using Proof-of-Work to signficantly incentivize its _generals_ to relay the truth (since any decision will require a large investment of time and compute power / money). As long as two-thirds of the network are now relaying the truth (correct decision), the network is now secure or truthful.

Check out the rest of the Nelson that walks through the entire proof using 7 generals (1 Head General and 6 lieutenants).

### Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake and other consensus algorithms

BFT solutions can still differ by the underlying consensus algorith they use to build the two-thirds majority. Bitcoin and Ethereum currently use Proof of Work by incentivize _truthful_ generals.

This piece of the solution can be innovated upon depending on the _available technology or economic design of its actors_.

A quick overview of **different Consensus protocols** by [CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/short-guide-blockchain-consensus-protocols?utm_referral=https://czhc.dev), and the core difference from Proof-of-Work:

* Proof of Stake: uses a stake (deposited amount) to signal influence and integrity. Bad nodes have their stake slashed.
* Proof of Activity: uses mining (cryptographic puzzle solving) to mine a block, and staking (financial ownership) to sign the block.
* Proof of Burn: incentivizes miners to burn its reward tokens for a higher chance to be reselected for mining new rewards.
* Proof of Capacity: uses storage capacity, instead of compute power, to select miners.
* Proof of Elasped Time: produces blocks in random lottery using an isolated execution environment in a processor - which guarantees integrating and confidentialy of data. This departs from the _economic incentive design_ of the other consensus algorithms.

In 2021, Proof-of-Stake is growing in adoption due to the expansion of crypto networks (more transactions) and the limitations of today's machines in terms of costs and computation. PoS is already deployed by major, high-TVL networks such as **[Polygon/Matic](https://docs.matic.network/docs/validate/basics/pos_staking_delegation/)**, **[Solana](https://solana.com/solana-whitepaper.pdf)**, **[Terra](https://consensusnetworks.com/terra/)** and Thor's **[Tendermint](https://web.archive.org/web/20181016060125/https://github.com/thorchain/Resources/blob/master/Whitepapers/THORChain/whitepaper-en.md)** - aside from the upcoming Ethereum 2.0's **[Casper protocol](https://github.com/cbc-casper/cbc-casper-paper/blob/master/cbc-casper-paper-draft.pdf)**

The discussion on PoW v. PoS is still ongoing, but I found [this thread](https://ercwl.medium.com/proof-of-stake-is-less-wasteful-b2854a191766?utm_referral=czhc.dev) useful for some numbers and to add more layers to the mental model.


## Crypto economy: Scarcity & Value, Mises Regression Theorem

[El Salvador](https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1402446890466217985) passed Bitcoin as legal tender, requiring all market participants to accept payments and pay taxes in BTC. This raised the question again: is Bitcoin money?


The Mises Regression Theorem discusses the **emergence of a medium of exchange** as:
> a _good_ with objective value from its own direct use, that later becomes subjectively valued as a function in indirect exchange.

The theorem is refuted if a _money_ emerges without prior objective value, regardless if it was tangible or unintangible in form.

The crux of the theorem stipulates:
>  The subjective exchange value of money (to hold) today takes place using, as a starting point, the objective exchange values of yesterday.

A new medium of exchange emerges from:

1. A pure barter economy, which the medium has a previous direct use, or
2. An existing money-price structure, or a memory of one.

Regardless of its tangibility. In this sense, while it is a non-fiat medium of exchange, Bitcoin does not invalidate the Regression Theorem.

The _price_ or value of Bitcoin has been modelled most popularly by its scarcity over time e.g [PlanB](https://medium.com/@100trillionUSD/modeling-bitcoins-value-with-scarcity-91fa0fc03e25)'s Stock-to-Flow model. It is still being validated - and I also recommend reading the counter-argument by [Strix Leviathan](https://strixleviathan.com/blog/2020/6/29/a-chameleon-model-why-bitcoins-stock-to-flow-model-is-fatally-flawed)

## A Call to Cryptographic Arms

Reflecting once again on _why we do what we do_, I thought it would be worth citing the following from Julian Assange's [Cypherpunks: Freedom and the Future of the Internet](https://www.amazon.com/Cypherpunks-Freedom-Internet-Julian-Assange/dp/1944869085), written in 2012, recently re-read at the [Bitcoin 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KgEjRKTZ9A) conference.

The Wikileaks resistance is directly in opposition with the US military and government, but the cypherpunk movement is re-envisioning the web of trust underpinning the global exchange of information that is the Internet. It is a truth that will succeed the majority of this living generation, but the challenge over the next century for the layperson to deconstruct and to understand it starts now.

Cryptography pits systemic power against the laws of physics and mathematics.
That is the future of the cypherpunks.
