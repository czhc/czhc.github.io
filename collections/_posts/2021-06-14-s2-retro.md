## A Call to Cryptographic Arms

Reflecting once again on _why we do what we do_, I thought it would be worth citing the following from Julian Assange's [Cypherpunks: Freedom and the Future of the Internet](https://www.amazon.com/Cypherpunks-Freedom-Internet-Julian-Assange/dp/1944869085), written in 2012, recently re-read at the [Bitcoin 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KgEjRKTZ9A) conference.

The Wikileaks resistance is directly in opposition with the US military and government, but the cypherpunk movement is re-envisioning the web of trust underpinning the global exchange of information that is the Internet. It is a truth that will succeed the majority of this living generation, but the challenge over the next century for the layperson to deconstruct and to understand it starts now.

Cryptography pits systemic power against the laws of physics and mathematics.
That is the future of the cypherpunks.
