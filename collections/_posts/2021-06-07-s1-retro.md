This being the maiden voyage of a currently tempestuous market climate - red candles, Musk tantrums and BTC v. ETH maxis at war - I thought it would be a good opportunity to dial back and review the origins of digital cash or cryptocurrencies. The _why we do what we do_.

## What is Money?

An economy is a series of activities consisting of an exchange of demand and supply. In a modern economy, these exchanges are facilitated by a tangible resource called money.

It is more helpful to first understand money in terms of _what it does_, than what it looks like. Money serves as a Means of Exchange or unit of account, Store of Value, representation of Debt, and reserve of Wealth. This extends into a discussion properties of money: fungibility, limited supply, divisibility etc.

The next chapter to discuss is on how a financial system and monetary policy is used to support an economy. I thought it was interesting to point out that the fiat system is essentially a circulating issuance of debt by a central bank - a _ponzi_ that endless borrows from person to person. Fiat money does not hold intrinsic value - see the _What is Money?_ argument again. From discussing this with some peers, I found this to be the quintissential decoupling to help the lay person cross the chasm and open themselves into the concept of a digital currency.

While these ideas aren't new in the age of cryptocurrencies, but I'd like to get to stage that I can confidently posit them with the right citations.

The first few clasess in [_Blockchain & Money_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH6vE97qIP4) by Gary Gensler (Goldman Sachs, SEC chairman) explores this very nicely. I recommend looking into the following as well to help build your own intuition:

* Mises Institute - [Principles of Sound Money](https://mises.org/library/principle-sound-money)

## What is Bitcoin?

More appropriately: what is a digital currency, and how does it compare to the current monetary system?

The layperson (_trades_) cryptocurrencies for their price action, and we should accurately distinguish them from investors. The original design for Bitcoin (and its predecessor [Hashcash](http://www.hashcash.org/papers/announce.txt)) explores much more than value appreciation based on a fixed supply. A lot of Bitcoin's inherent value derives from tamper-proof mechanisms in its technical application (cryptography, cost functions, Proof-of-Work) and economical design (Expected Utility Theory, Gambler's Ruin).

I have a lot more appreciation for POW as a choice in security, despite its impact in ecological footprint. It moves the burden of proof, however, towards building more energy-efficient technology, instead of a knee-jerk rejection to Bitcoin altogether. Despite living in an age of information, it seems like the common person thinks in simplified and absolute terms - one or the other. I'd like to see sufficient argument against POW itself. Bringing up the argument of carbon footprint does not dispute the merits of a trustless, decentralized money, and we can do better to avoid [whatabout-ism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS82JNd0YzQ) logical fallacy.

I recommend reading the Bitcoin whitepaper several times, taking each turn to focus on the technical and financial designs separately. Use the POW visual explanation to help map the process of minting and transacting cryptocurrencies to the fiat system, keeping in mind that once again, paper money is still an issuance of debt and representation of labored value.

## Derivatives: Perpetuals

Perpetuals are non-expiring versions of futures contracts that distinctly allows traders to (1) open positions with high leverage and (2) get short exposure without owning the asset. Inverse perps also allow for price speculation using holdings in a given asset instead of holding fiat. They're native to cryptocurrency exchanges, with the common DEXes being [dydx](https://dydx.exchange/), [futureswap](https://www.futureswap.com/), [Perpetual Protocol](https://perp.fi/) and [MCDEX](https://mcdex.io/)

Some good introduction to perpetual contracts:

* [dydx](https://integral.dydx.exchange/comparing-perpetual-markets/) - comparing perpetual markets
* [binance](https://academy.binance.com/cs/articles/what-are-perpetual-futures-contracts) - what are perpetual futures contracts

This post by [Weiting Chen](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/how-to-use-perpetuals-for-non-speculators) makes two points for perpetual swaps:

1. profiting against price drops during a locked, staking period.
2. profiting against IL.


I don't have the luxury of time, and I have not gone over the numbers to see if the cost of experiment and risks are justified by the returns. I noticed that there is an assumption that in the bull-scenario, LP yield stays at 3-digit % over duration of lockup. Otherwise, since the net profit has to mostly come from LP gains - the given 17% ($53k) is overestimated.

But it is a good experiment to run because the high APY LPs are typically digital dollar pairs and IL is a huge cost for small baskets.

Perp Protocol runs on xDAI and would make the cost of experiment significantly lower. More strategies here:

## Borrow to Lend to Borrow: the Degen game

Rather late to the MATIC-Aave-Curve tumbling machine, but I've always preferred to exercise caution over aping:

* Taiki Maeda: [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZaMcMMSJwY)
* [Stakingbits](https://medium.com/stakingbits/guide-to-yield-farming-with-aave-on-polygon-matic-network-a03bd2154275): Yield Farming with Aave on Polygon

This strategy is mostly valid until June 14th after which a second liquidity mining program with the equivalent 0.5% supply allocation is diluted to Apr 2022.

I ran through the numbers and am looking at a net **32% APY @ 1 MATIC = 1.60 USD**. It includes some assumptions which I still can't access for example, the MATIC reward APY% for DAI borrows against the MATIC reward APY% for MATIC deposits, which I denoted as a constant _k_ - I'm assuming that to be linear, but that's a very wild approximation.

There are other variables to consider, and how to respond to MATIC price action and continue to profit. More in the next post.

There are some more Degen 101 materials I covered as well, but I'll call out these unassorted ones for now:
