This being the maiden voyage of a currently tempestuous market climate - red candles, Musk tantrums and BTC v. ETH maxis at war - I thought it would be a good opportunity to dial back and review the origins of digital cash or cryptocurrencies. The _why we do what we do_.

## What is Money?

An economy is a series of activities consisting of an exchange of demand and supply. In a modern economy, these exchanges are facilitated by a tangible resource called money.

It is more helpful to first understand money in terms of _what it does_, than what it looks like. Money serves as a Means of Exchange or unit of account, Store of Value, representation of Debt, and reserve of Wealth. This extends into a discussion properties of money: fungibility, limited supply, divisibility etc.

The next chapter to discuss is on how a financial system and monetary policy is used to support an economy. I thought it was interesting to point out that the fiat system is essentially a circulating issuance of debt by a central bank - a _ponzi_ that endless borrows from person to person. Fiat money does not hold intrinsic value - see the _What is Money?_ argument again. From discussing this with some peers, I found this to be the quintissential decoupling to help the lay person cross the chasm and open themselves into the concept of a digital currency.

While these ideas aren't new in the age of cryptocurrencies, but I'd like to get to stage that I can confidently posit them with the right citations.

The first few clasess in [_Blockchain & Money_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH6vE97qIP4) by Gary Gensler (Goldman Sachs, SEC chairman) explores this very nicely. I recommend looking into the following as well to help build your own intuition:

## What is Bitcoin?

More appropriately: what is a digital currency, and how does it compare to the current monetary system?

The layperson (_trades_) cryptocurrencies for their price action, and we should accurately distinguish them from investors. The original design for Bitcoin (and its predecessor [Hashcash](http://www.hashcash.org/papers/announce.txt)) explores much more than value appreciation based on a fixed supply. A lot of Bitcoin's inherent value derives from tamper-proof mechanisms in its technical application (cryptography, cost functions, Proof-of-Work) and economical design (Expected Utility Theory, Gambler's Ruin).

I have a lot more appreciation for POW as a choice in security, despite its impact in ecological footprint. It moves the crux of the conversation, however, towards building more energy-efficient technology, instead of a knee-jerk reaction to rejecting Bitcoin altogether. Despite living in an age of information, it seems like the common person thinks in simplified and absolute terms - one or the other. I have yet to see an argument against the technology of POW currencies itself. Bringing up the argument of carbon footprint does not dispute the merits of a trustless, decentralized money - it is no different from the Trump [whatabout-ism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS82JNd0YzQ) logical fallacy.

I recommend reading the Bitcoin whitepaper several times, taking each turn to focus on the technical and financial designs separately. Use the POW visual explanation to help map the process of minting and transacting cryptocurrencies to the fiat system, keeping in mind that once again, paper money is still an issuance of debt and representation of labored value.
