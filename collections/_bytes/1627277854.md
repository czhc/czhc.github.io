# 3 survival themes in this space

### 1. Privacy by default

All information is private, until it is volunteered or surrendered.
Privacy is not a given by an authority or institution.

### 2. Trust no one

All actors are economically-rational and are only interested in self-profits.

### 3. Do your own research

In an age of open information, acting without tangible, provable data is irresponsible and guarantees inevitable self-harm.
