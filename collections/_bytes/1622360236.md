# Happiness is

Happiness is.

Finding a pulse in the push and pull. It is calm, clear and infinite. 

Happiness is not a pursuit. It is not a reward, paid with hardships, or bought with gold.\
It is not given at birth, and as such cannot be taken away. 

It is a moment written, neither the one before nor after.\
It is the silence heard. Let it reverberate in each breath.\
It is kind and present. Find it in absence, loss and grief.

Happiness is simple.

Happiness is.
