# Happiness is

Happiness is.

Finding a pulse in the push and pull. It is calm, clear and infinite. 

Happiness is not a pursuit. It is not a reward paid with hardships, or bought with gold.\
It is not given. And it can not be taken away.

It is a moment in time, neither one before nor after. Cup it in your hands, let it runneth over.\
It is the silence heard. Feel it reverberate in each breath.\
It is kind and it is present. Find it in absence, loss and grief.

Happiness is simple.\
Happiness is.
