Recruitment metrics are typically measured by a combination of time, cost and qualitative parameters. A 2018 Talent Trends research by Randstand lists Quality of Hire (QOH) as a top recruitment metric (as scored by 72% of C-suite and human capital leaders).

The ROI measurement of a talent acquisition process is assessed by (QOH) out of hidden operational costs incurred by number of participants and time spent on interviewing a candidate. In a dense, highly competitive field with industry jargons, most of acqusition costs are attributable to the first service layer of typically outsourced recruitment services.

This project proposes to improvise the QOH of first layer talent acquisition processes using supervised learning over a personalized set of optimization goals and employment history of a given company.
